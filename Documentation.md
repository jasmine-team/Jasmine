## Requirements

### Overview

#### Introduction
We aim to help English speakers improve their command of Chinese through a gamified educational app, making their learning experience fun and engaging. 

Our app includes various features such as weekly leaderboards and achievements that encourage the users to practise consistently, which is crucial in maintaining language proficiency.

#### Why Chinese
With over 1.2 billion Chinese speakers in the world and the emergence of China as a global economic superpower, bringing along a huge potential market comprising 18% of the world population, mastering the Chinese language has become more vital than ever. 

In Singapore, our founding father has long recognized the importance of the Chinese language and hence enforced bilingualism in our education policy. However, despite government initiatives such as the Speak Mandarin Campaign, Chinese language proficiency among Singaporean Chinese continue to deteriorate rapidly. Apart from the pragmatic economic concerns, the lack of proficiency in one’s own mother tongue also erodes one’s cultural identity, dignity and self-confidence.

As such, it is imperative for new strategies to be adopted to improve Chinese proficiency among Singaporean Chinese. Furthermore, there has been a growing interest in the Chinese language among non-Chinese ethnic groups. 

Our app therefore seeks to make the arduous journey of learning the Chinese language fun and enjoyable.

While our focus is on Chinese, we aim to make the project architecture flexible so that support for other languages can be easily implemented in the future.

#### Existing applications
While there are many existing applications for learning Chinese, they are not fun and engaging in general. For instance, an app named “Learn Chinese the Fun Way” comprise mainly dictionary definitions and penmanship exercises with barely any elements of fun. Another app named “Chinese Idioms Game” merely provides a picture hint and scrambled words for the user to guess the idiom. Lastly, an app named “ChineseSkill” consists of multiple choice questions requiring the user to pick the correct picture matching the given word. As can be seen, these apps are dull and boring in nature despite claiming to be game-based.

#### Why our app
The gamification of learning has long be proven to be beneficial in various aspects, such as providing the users autonomy in their learning, making learning visible and the freedom to fail and retry without consequences. Most importantly, it makes the learning experience fun and enjoyable, motivating the users to improve continuously and practise frequently, which is crucial to maintain language proficiency. For instance, a gamified platform known as Coursemology is well received by students and has been proven in be effective. 

As such, in our application, we plan to couple learning with fun games so that users are motivated to consistently enhance their Chinese proficiency in a fun way. We also plan to target users at all levels of proficiency, spanning from the beginners to the experts, by including a wide spectrum of  difficulty levels. 

### Revised Specification
We are adding a new game type called "Sliding Game". Similar to the [15-puzzle sliding puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle), there will a grid with an empty cell in it. The player must swap the empty cell with neighbouring cells to form 3 valid phrases either vertically or horizontally. Given that there is an empty cell, there will be an incomplete phrase with 1 missing word, which can act as a diversion to confuse the player.

We are also changing the swapping game to allow valid phrases to be formed either horizontally or vertically (previously only horizontally). This is to standardize the gameplay for all 3 games (swapping, sliding, tetris), by allowing both horizontal and vertical arrangement of valid phrases. 

The scores for swapping and sliding games will be changed to account for the time taken and number of moves (swaps/slides) performed (number of moves not used previously). Since valid phrases are allowed either vertically or horizontally, players will have to consider whether horizontal or vertical arrangement for that game instance is better to minimize the number of swaps.

We are also adding more customizability to the game. In particular, we now allow users to create custom levels with their custom set of phrases. This gives the users more control over the phrases they want to practise on. Users can also import phrases from other levels and merge them to their custom levels.

For the tetris game, to improve the difficulty of the game, the upcoming tiles will not include the entire phrase. Instead, a certain number of phrases (currently set at 2) will be generated to populate the upcoming tiles randomly, so that the phrases to be tested are only revealed fully after a few turns.

For the tetris game, we also implemented an innovative way to get rid of tiles that the user did not manage to solve successfully and has become indestrutible due to their positionings. A phrase containing the words on these tiles will be added to the upcoming tiles pool. Upon successfully forming the phrase and destroying it, all tiles with words that are contained in the destroyed tiles will also be instantly destroyed, and tiles above all the destroyed tiles will be shifted down accordingly. Additional tiles destroyed in this manner will not give additional scores.

### Performance
We can achieve 60 FPS on both the iPhone and the iPad, as the game animation and physics are simple enough.

#### Tetris game type
- Number of tiles in the grid are currently set at 12x8, which is unlikely to go much higher due to screen size limit
- There will only be 1 falling tile at a time
- There will at most be 12x8 tiles being animated (shifted down or destroyed)

#### Swapping game type
- At most 16 cells in the Swapping game type, where at any instance only 2 cells will be shifted.

#### Sliding game type
- At most 16 cells in the sliding game type, where at any instance only 1 cell will be shifted.

Also, we target our game to run with less than 150 MB of memory, and with more than 70% CPU usage for only 10% of the time.

## Testing

### Strategy

#### Models
Models should have their own unit tests ensuring that their defaults variables are set correctly, as well as the correct implementation of any computed properties and functions. Tests will be devised for the normal case as well as the failure case. There will be tests for every branching in the code, such as if and guard statements.

#### View Models
ViewModels are disjoint from the View, and hence can be easily testable. The non-private methods should be tested to ensure correct behaviour, and a mock that fulfills certain delegate protocols should be implemented to ensure that the delegates are called as they should have.

#### View Controllers
For ViewControllers, they are highly reliant on black box testing due to the large variability of GUI testing. Since views do not contain any significant logic, if the Models and ViewModels are tested well, views can then be tested with black box testing.

#### Performance Tests 
We use the Mac's in-built `Instruments` application to measure the FPS. We conducted a few typical game runs and recorded the mean and range of the FPS. Also, we can measure the performance via CPU and memory usage, ensuring that they are within reasonable level.

#### Stress Tests
We have also performed some basic stress test on the tetris game such as rapidly tapping the grid to shift the falling tile left, right, or down, and rapid swapping of the tiles in the swapping game. Multiple simutaneous tap gestures are also tested.

For the Tetris game, we will stack up multiple full columns then destroy the bottom most row to stress test the shifting down of multiple full columns of tiles.

For swapping and sliding grid game, we have stress test it by spamming touch gestures right onto the view, ensuring that the game area does not break.

Other stress tests may include having the application to handle a huge database of Chinese vocabulary (~20000 words), and ensure that the performance of the app is still acceptable.

#### Regression Tests
We protected the master branch on our github repository (https://github.com/jasmine-team/Jasmine) and set up the Travis CI to require every test cases to pass before the pull request can be merged to the master branch. We also repeat the black-box testing of related UI components for every major build or UI changes.

### Results
As our project implements Travis CI service, our `master` branch build is passing with ~60% code coverage. Do note that some code paths such as private functions, singletons and game center related code are largely untestable. Do note that if the project has yet to implement some of the tests described in the Appendix (including the black box testing), they are replaced by black-box tests.

The performance tests showed that we can achieve our targeted FPS of 60 for our Tetris and Swapping games, even with animations.

The stress tests helped us find certain bugs that can only happen in extreme conditions such as moving tiles in the Swapping game that hasn't landed yet. Now that we have fixed them, these tests showed that the UI remains responsive and we can maintain the desired performance at the current level of animation.

## Designs

### Overview

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/O3d0pQq.png">

Our application adopts the MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel) pattern. This is the pattern adopted in most iOS applications; even Apple’s “MVC” framework is closer to MVVM than actual MVC. The model contains the main objects of the app, the ViewModel contains game logic and the View (consisting of ViewControllers and the UIViews) displays the representation of the game on the screen. 

We choose the MVVM design over the MVC design to avoid having a disproportionately large VC. A separation between the view and model also allows the models to be changed without the need to change the view. The separation also improves readability, maintainability, scalability, as well as the testability of the view model.

We have 3 game modes (Swapping, Tetris, Sliding) and 2 game types (Cheng Yu and Ci Hui). In our games, we aim to achieve a clean partition between the game _types_ and the respective game _modes_, so that different game modes can be added for each game type in the future. Hence, there is a ViewController corresponding to each game type and a ViewModel corresponding to each (game mode, game type) pair that extends the base ViewModel/ViewController for the game type to provide specific functionalities for the different game mode. Each ViewController handles how each game type is displayed on the screen, and returning the user inputs to the ViewModel. ViewModel then governs the rules of the game, and handles the logic of the game, and then tells the ViewController what to be displayed on screen. 

While each ViewController holds the corresponding ViewModel object, each ViewModel also holds communication pathways to the VC in the form of delegates. The delegates are separated based on their functionality; for example, `TimeUpdateDelegate` provides the ViewModel means to update the time stored in the ViewController, and `ScoreUpdateDelegate` lets the VM update the score in VC. This ensures that a 2-way connection between VM and VC is established. We implemented `ViewModelProtocol`s to be adopted by ViewModels, and the delegates to be adopted by ViewControllers. The protocol acts as a facade and makes the communication between the ViewModels and ViewControllers clear and explicit. This reduces the constant need for communication between the VC and the VM developers and eliminates any potential misunderstanding of the interface between the VM and VC. Furthermore, if we were to create a new game mode, all we need is to create a ViewModel that corresponds to the game mode, that conforms to the specific game type's view model protocol. This allows for simple and clear extensions to our games.

We also created a `CountDownTimer` class. ViewModels that use a timer in their games will have this `CountDownTimer` inside the VMs. There was an interesting discussion about this timer; we had three options to choose from:
- Use a `TimedViewModel` class, and ViewModels that need a timer subclass from that class
- Use a `TimedViewModel` protocol, and ViewModels that need a timer implements that protocol
- The current approach (an independent class that is contained in the ViewModels)

After discussion, we decided to stick to our current implementation. Using a class doesn't sound right in a protocol-oriented framework; besides, every class can only subclass once, and if more features are to be implemented, there will be more classes like this that the VMs need to implement. We tried to use a protocol with default implementations inside protocol extensions ("abstract class"). However, that does not work quite well as stored properties cannot be set or declared in an extension. As a result, we need to set each of the stored properties in each of the main view model classes, which clusters up the view model classes, especially when other functionalities such as sound are introduced. Furthermore, certain initializations, such as setting `timeRemaining` to `totalTimeAllowed` would have to be done in the init of the main view model classes even though such logic should be handled by the timer class. Hence the current implementation is chosen to avoid these problems and provide a cleaner solution.

For our Tetris game, we debated whether to let the view model control the falling tile and constantly update the view controller to redisplay the falling tile on its new position, or to simply let the view controller control the falling tile and notify the view model when the falling tile has landed. We decided to go with the latter as it allows the view controller greater control over how the falling tile is animated, such as whether it should fall discretely, row by row, or continously. Also, the view models (for three game mode) can focus on implementing the game mechanics without worrying about how the tiles fall in each game mode, as this is a UI component. What is only required from the view model is for the view controller to ask the view model whether the tile can be moved to a particular coordinate or to land, which maintains the encapsulation, and avoids processing of the view model's data.

Another interesting design issue is on code duplication. Apparently, there are some code duplication, as assessed by Codebeat. In particular, there are some duplication between the Grid ViewModels (`SlidingCiHui`, `SwappingCiHui`, `SlidingChengYu`, `SwappingChengYu`). Indeed, since we decided to split the `GridViewModel` into `SlidingViewModel` and `SwappingViewModel`, there are some duplication between the `CiHui` view models and `ChengYu` view models. If Swift supports multiple inheritance in some cases, this could have been solved more gracefully.

However, since Swift doesn't support multiple inheritance, we had the choice of either putting the code in the `BaseViewModel`, or splitting and duplicating them into the corresponding ViewModels. In the end, we decided to combine some into the Base VM, while still duplicating some of them. Indeed, there is a choice here between writing it in one place and making it DRY, or decoupling them and increasing extensibility. For example, we decided to decouple the scoring system in both games (`checkGameWon`) since the grid games should be flexible in how the game decides how to score, which tiles to highlight, and how to win. (What if the entire grid needs to be in a certain position?)

For the models, we are using `Realm`, for these reasons:
- Realm handles migrations much more cleanly than iOS's CoreData
- There is no need to deal with Objective-C type limitations with Realm as compared to CoreData
- Queries can be chained easily without performance issues
- Realm makes the classes more testable through ability to set Realm instances through dependency injection. 
- Realm performance is much better, and does not load all data immediately into memory.
- There is an app that allows you to edit Realm databases like an excel sheet.

We are also using a shared grid model called `TextGrid`, as an abstraction over grids containing Strings. These grids map `Coordinate` to `String`, and is used in our swapping, tetris, and sliding game modes.

Some libraries that we use in our CocoaPods are:
| Library    | Purpose                                    |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Realm      | a mobile database and ORM                  |
| SwiftLint  | a linter for Swift to enforce coding style |
| Chameleon  | a color framework                          |
| SnapKit    | programatically fit constraints onto views |
| SwiftDate  | clean and easy date operations             |

Some other third-party things that we use include:
| Tool      | Purpose                                                                                             |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Travis CI | to ensure compilation works and tests pass                                                          |
| CodeCov   | for code coverage report                                                                            |
| Synx      | a tool that automatically matches the file directory structure with the grouping structure in XCode |
| CodeBeat  | a tool that assesses the codebase and reports lower-quality code                                    |

#### Trade-Off
One of the tradeoffs of this design (overall architecture) is that there will be more ViewModels to work with, which if not carefully managed, may result in more code and duplication. This is slightly mitigated due to CodeBeat coverage which looks out for duplication in code.

In addition, since many kinds of ViewModels are expected to work with ViewControllers, the design of ViewControllers is crucial. If not designed well where methods are extensible, additional ViewControllers may need to be introduced, defeating the point of this pattern.

Lastly, MVVM may be quite a new architecture pattern for people to get used to, and thus may introduce code where responsibility is not cleanly separated. Ensuring that the team understands the pattern is thus essential.

### Runtime Structure

The models consist of `Phrase`, the most important data component. It encapsulates one or more words in many different languages, such as Chinese and English (for the time being). A single data type keeps data persisting easy to manage since there's only one "table" to be copied. For the internal variables for Realm, a string is used to represent the Pin Yin with a space as the delimiter. An array of String would be more appropriate as it'd allow the extensibility of having spaces in a word, and other classes using the class will not need to be aware of the magical space delimiter. However, Realm does not support storing an array of primitives, hence the String is used for the internal representation for Realm, and a wrapper that turns the String into [String] is created for public access from other classes.
`Phrases` encapsulates the realm results object returned through a query, and hides away Realm implementation details behind functions exposed to ViewModels. 
Initially, we thought that `Phrases` just have to store the list of phrases tested in a level. However, we realized there could be situations where the user form a phrase that is valid and in the database but not in the list of phrases tested for that level. Hence to avoid false negative `Phrases` would contain the entire database of phrases to check against, and hence the need for Realm to store the list lazily as the database would be enormous to be stored in memory. 

Another model is the `Level`, which is a representation of a game level, and contains necessary information to create such a level to play a game. All `Level` objects can be found via `Levels`, which is retrievable through `Storage` singleton.

Every ViewModel would hold `GameData` which represents data necessary, such as Phrases for a game, all of which is created by a `GameDataManager`. This keeps the Model layer clean and simple, separated from the other responsibilities. Since all models (`Phrase` and `PlayerData`) are direct Realm objects, performance co-relates to Realm's amazing performance.

The grid data across all games are represented by the `TextGrid` model. We represent the content to be displayed on each tile as String instead of Character as this would allow multiple characters to be displayed on the tile, which would be needed to display Pin Yin. `Coordinate` is a struct containing 2 integers representing the column and row number on the grid. However, we decided to represent the `TextGrid` with a 2D array of `String?`, which is `[[String?]]`, as it provides a more natural way in our methods in `TextGrid` such as getting a row. It also retains efficient O(1) time complexity for read/write to the grid.

The `UICollectionView` will be implemented with every row on the grid belonging to 1 section. Hence `IndexPath.row` will correspond to the column number while `IndexPath.section` will correspond to the row number on the grid. As this is unintuitive and hard to visualise, we choose to use the Coordinate struct instead of IndexPath to represent the tile location on the grid for our data model. A mapping between `IndexPath` and `Coordinate` has been done via an extension in `IndexPath`.

### Module Structure
Refer to above class diagram under "overview" for an overview of our module structure.

#### General Component: View Model - Model Interaction
Models are generally all Realm objects, with their governing objects (e.g. `Phrases` for `Phrase` realm object) exposed for use to view models. View models will query for information through these governing objects as needed.

All GameData object are created through`GameManager` which holds the spawned level object. GameData acts as a token to be passed throughout stages of the game play. Information can be stored and obtained as needed through this generic GameData object.

Due to the efficiency of Realm only recalling data in which it is needed, certain choices between converting realm collections to native swift arrays are considered between performance and convenience.

Realm is never exposed to the View Models and thus dependency on realm is largely contained within the models layer. Should a change in storage library be needed, view model will not need a large refactoring to do so.

#### Game Component: View Controller - View Model Interaction
As illustrated above, our game component consists of the game view controller and its accompanying view model.

The MVVM pattern, the 2-way communication between VM-VC through a pre-agreed set of view model protocols and view controller delegates (in that VC contains VM protocol and VM contains a delegate protocol that goes to VC), and the VM class that implements each (game type, game mode) pair allows the project to be decoupled enough. Each class has its own responsibility and this allows us to have a better division of work, since the use of protocols allows people working on the VC does not need to wait until the people working on the VM to be done, and vice versa. This also allows the testability of view controllers and the view models by means of dependency injection.

##### Game Component
For the ViewModels, there is a `BaseViewModelProtocol` that is adopted by all game engines. This base VM adopts the `GameDescriptorProtocol` (describes the game). We included `TimeDescriptorProtocol` (describes the timing of the game) and `ScoreDescriptorProtocol` (describes the score of the game) that the implementing game view model can adopt only when they need it, which also explains why we subdivide it in this manner. Each of the above protocols comes with a corresponding `XDescriptorDelegate` that the implementing view controller can implement for the view model to call, and the view controller to listen for data updates. This interactions reduces copuling to a single direction between the view controller and view model.

Subsequently, we have `TetrisViewModelProtocol` that extends the `BaseViewModelProtocol` directly, while the protocols `SlidingGameViewModelProtocol` and `SwappingGameViewModelProtocol` extend the `GridViewModelProtocol` that extends the Base protocol, since there are so many similarities between the two games. For each of these game type specific protocols (except Tetris), 2 classes will extend them, corresponding to the 2 game modes.

##### Other View Components
Likewise, similar principles are applied to other view components, such as `LevelSelector`, `LevelDesigner`, and `PhraseExplorer` views.

#### View Controllers

##### Square Grid View Controller Family
In the view controller, we aimed to achieve having high flexibility for the view components to be reused. Specifically, a generic `SquareGridViewController` and `GameStatisticsViewController` is used to display a m-by-n square grid, and in-game statistics such as time remaining and game score. This keeps the main view controllers such as `SwappingGameViewController`, `SwipingGameViewController` and `TetrisGameViewController` small as most of the operations are done inside the generic controllers itself. There is no need to recode la collection view controller for `SwappingGameVC`, `SlidingGameVC` and `TetrisGameVC` respectively. 

To allow greater customisability to the `SquareGridViewController`, we have establised an hierarical system for this view controller. Along with a trivial display of tiles, `DraggableSquareGridVC`, `DiscreteFallingSquareGridVC` and `SelectableSquareGridViewController` are built upon with the ability of dragging and dropping of tiles, the falling of tiles, and the selectability of tiles. 

These implementation keeps each class/file size small while at the same time provides sophiscated functionalities to each game type. For example, Tetris game can now rely on `DiscreteFallingSquareGridVC` to display its main falling grid, and a simple `SquareGridViewController` to display the upcoming tiles. By designing the game view controller to be higly modularised with various embedded view controllers, we have improved code reuse and reduces the coupling between the view controllers and the native `UICollectionView`. 

In fact, `GameOverViewController` is able to reuse `SelectableSquareGridViewController` without having to recode the entire collection view to display a simple list of phrases. Also, the weekly streak in the `ProfileViewController` is made up of `SquareGridViewController` as well.

With this regard, we have applied this similar pricinple to other reusable view controllers such as  `GameStatisticsViewController` and  `SimpleStartGameViewController`.

##### View Controller Inheritance
We understand that traditional view of inheritance cannot be apply to view controllers, simply because there exist a one to one mapping and view attachment between view controllers and the layout in the storyboard. However, there are avenues where there are overlaps in code (e.g. `SwappingGridGameViewController` and `SwipingGameViewController`), so we created a `BaseGameViewController` class between the three game VCs, and have the children classes to pass their shared view element up to the parent class. 

Similar implementation has been done between the grid games through `BaseGridGameViewController`, and all view controllers in general via `JasmineViewController`. In particular, having a general `JasmineViewController` allows for a central control over the themeing of the views, such as controlling the colour the navigation bar, and the status bar colour.

Although this reduces code duplication between various view controllers and improve sharing of properties between VCs (e.g. themeing), one significant trade-off is that it increases coupling between the hierarchy, simply because both the parent VC class and the children VC class has to know whether the actual view in storyboard is attached.

## Reflection

### Evaluation
The architecture of the code is something that we are proud of. A very good separability between the components are achieved. This made our development very conformtable.

As a tradeoff, though, our development speed is quite slow. We are quite particular about minor things. As time progresses, though, we are slowly becoming more lenient, trading off code quality with development speed.

Also, since the design keeps on changing, the tests need to be changed as well. Some parts of the application are harder to test, making it more time-consuming in writing tests. In particular, the Grid games are still quite hard to test until now, since the movement of tiles is limited. It's as if we are creating an artificial intelligence to play the game.

Setting up tools such as CODEBEAT to assess the quality of our code has been really helpful, as automatic code review allows us to catch ugly codes and improve our code quality early on. As a result of our efforts, we have achieve grade B on the code quality rating provided by CODEBEAT.

One might wonder why we achieved a B and not an A. We looked into it and most of them are caused by code duplication. There is always a tradeoff between code duplication and extensibility though, as described above in the "Designs" section. Do note that CODEBEAT standards are also quite strict, (e.g. having only 6 properties would be deducted for having too many instance properties)

### Lessons
Previously, we felt that our work is progressing very slowly; at this pace, we will not be able to complete the app in 6 weeks. The main problem we found out is in our collaboration flow.

Originally, we wanted all four people to review every pull request so that everyone knows exactly what is going to be pushed to `master`. This does not work so well, though, since not everyone is always active. Some trivial pull requests, such as the addition of a library, can require hours or even days to be merged.

Also, we realized that we are too picky in our guidelines. Sometimes we ask the author of a PR to just change variable names or even comments. This resulted in the PR taking even longer time to be merged, because we ask the author of the PR to make these trivial changes again and again. We also spent so much time debating trivial things such as line length (maximum number of characters in a length).

To solve these problems, we decided on these things:
1. A PR needs to be reviewed by only one reviewer before being merged
2. Anyone can push trivial changes to anyone's branches, as long as the author of the branch is being notified
3. We will try to meet every Monday 4pm-6pm and Friday 12pm-2pm. We will require at least 2 people to be present in every timeslot. This allows face-to-face pair programming which allows us to make faster and better decisions.

We have adopted these changes since last Friday and our work has been much more productive ever since.

Also, our general architecture has slight changes compared to the design outlined in the first document. We think this is natural; designs are bound to changed if they are found unsuitable for the app.

Sometimes we have a hard time deciding how certain things should be implemented (some of which are mentioned above). To save time, we decided to simply go with the one that is simplest to implement, and change it accordingly should the need arise.

We think that Prof. Ben is right by saying that there was an issue with team dynamics. A way to solve this would probably be choosing someone to be the team leader and let him/her be the team arbiter.

### Known Bugs and Limitations
1. Sometimes the sound fails blackbox testing (likely due to inconsistency of timers).
2. There might be instances where sound effects continue to play after a game gesture is spammed.
3. Audio levels do not persist between app restarts.
4. Clearing and drag-gesture multi-selecting of all checkmarkable views (`PhraseExplorerVC`, `LevelImporterVC`) are not supported at this point.


## Appendix

### Formats
No user format is exposed.

Local requirements need `prebundled.realm` file to seed the information in the database.

In the directory, we have a Python3 script that scraps phrases from an API and stores it in a Realm file. To generate the phrases, we have a set of instructions written in the `README.md` file, reproduced here:

1. First copy the secrets file: `cd scripts && cp secrets.example.py secrets.py `
2. Set up environment variables by changing the file `secrets.py`
3. Run `python3 api.py` to populate the CSV file
4. Download [Realm browser](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/realm-browser/id1007457278?mt=12) and import CSV to turn it into Realm file
5. Replace the Realm file in `Jasmine/Common/prebundled.realm` with the produced Realm file

We also have a Python script that generates the metadata necessary for game center and creates and achievements and leaderboards from the `Level.csv` file. Instructions are reproduced here:

1. Find iTMS, usually in `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Application Loader.app/Contents/itms`
2. Run `iTMSTransporter -m upload -u <user> -p <password> -f <path>/Jasmine/scripts` to upload
3. Run `iTMSTransporter -m lookupMetadata -u <user> -p <password> -apple_id 1223383989 -destination <path>/Jasmine/scripts` to download metadata
